## Abstract
Texture bestows important characteristics of many types of images in computer vision and classifying textures is one of the most challenging problems in pattern recognition which draws the attention of computer vision researchers over many decades. Recently with the popularity of deep learning algorithms, particularly Convolution Neural Network (CNN), researchers can extract features that helped them to improve the performance of tasks like object detection and recogni- tion significantly over previous handcrafted features. In texture classification, the CNN layers can be used as filter banks for feature extraction whose complexity will increase with the depth of the network. In this study, we introduce a novel multitask texture classifier(MTL-TCNN) where we used multitask learning instead of pretraining sharing feature representation between two common tasks; one task being identifying the objects from Imagenet dataset using Alexnet and second, being classifying the textures using TCNN3. For evaluation, we used two standard benchmark datasets (KTH-Tips and DTD) for texture classifi- cation. Our experiments demonstrated enhanced performance classifying textures over TCNN3.
